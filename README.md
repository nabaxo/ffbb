# FFic BBang - A tool for organising bang events for fan fic fandoms.

This is the source code, enjoy! It's built with React, Create-React-App, TypeScript, and Firebase.

## Instructions

If you wanna run it yourself, follow these steps.

1. Create a Firebase web-app
2. Clone the repo
3. Create src/firebaseConfig.ts and export your Firebase-secret as firebaseConfig
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm start`
6. Enjoy!

## More stuff

Since this is based on Create React App, you have the usual available scripts to you, like:

- `npm start`
- `npm test`
- `npm build`
- `npm eject` (Don't do this unless you know what you're doing!)

Please refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more information!
